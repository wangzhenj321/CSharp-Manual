**Declaring** - Declaring a variable means to introduce a new variable to the program. You define its type and its name.

```C#
int a; // a is declared
```

**Instantiate** - Instantiating a class means to create a new instance of the class.

```C#
MyObject x = new MyObject(); // we are making a new instance of the class MyObject
```

**Initialize** - To initialize a variable means to assign it an initial value.

```C#
int a;                       // a is declared
int a = 0;                   // a is declared and initialized to 0
MyObject x = new MyObject(); // x is declared and initialized with an instance of MyObject
```

**Assigning** - Assigning to a variable means to provide the variable with a value.

```C#
int a = 0; // we are assigning to a; yes, initializing a variable means you assign it a value, so they do overlap!
a = 1;     // we are assigning to a
```
