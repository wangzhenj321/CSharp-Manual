## using directive

The `using` directive has three uses:
- To allow the use of types in a namespace so that you do not have to qualify the use of a type in that namespace:
	```c#
	using System.Text; 
	```
- To allow you to access static members of a type without having to qualify the access with the type name.
	```c#
	
	```
